## Overview

<img src="docs/source/images/asterisc_infog.png" align="left" width="175"/>

AsteRISC is a flexible multi-cycle RISC-V core designed for design space exploration. 

It is written in platform-independent SystemVerilog and targets both FPGAs and ASIC technologies.

Supported RISC-V extensions: `RV32`[`I`/`E`][`M`][`C`][`Zicsr`]

## Key Features

- Architectural flexibility for generating a wide array of microarchitectures.
- Designed to cater to diverse performance requirements and application scenarios.
- Suited for both FPGA and physical (ASIC) implementation.
